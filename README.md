# GPT-3 - Source
Okay, thats the real source of the GPT-3 discord bot on **discord.py** which could generate DALL-E 2.0 images and GPT-3 prompts.
Also, it's should support google search engine but it didn't released still.

## Commands
        - `/chat [Any prompt]` Talk with GPT-3!
        - `/imagine [Any prompt]` Generate any image which you want using DALL-E 2.0!
        - `/public` Make GPT-3 prompts public.
        - `/private` Make GPT-3 prompts private.
        - `/reset` Clear all requests which was sent by user to GPT-3.

## How to setup it?
Setup your api keys in env.dev and rename it to .env in folder on your PC.

## Which sources was used?
https://github.com/TheExplainthis/ChatGPT-Discord-Bot/blob/main/README.en.md (DALL-E 2.0 command)
https://github.com/Zero6992/chatGPT-discord-bot (help/chat/private/public/reset commands)

## It still have any issues?
*It's too slow, because I didn't used cogs and other optimizing things.*

Use an English language when you are using it to avoid any problems.
Additional: DALL-E picture logging is works but any cyrillic language turns into "???".

## I'm searching for logs!
GPT-3: chatgpt_discord_bot.log

DALL-E 2.0: dalle_discord_bot.log

## Don't forget!
If you want to use GPT-3 in future or make it better, please do an fork on GitHub.
Mention source in "About Me" in your Discord Bot as me did.
