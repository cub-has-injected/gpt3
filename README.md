# GPT-3 - Source (deprecated)
Okay, thats the source of the GPT-3 discord bot on **discord.py** which could generate DALL-E 2.0 images and GPT-3 prompts.
Also, It should support google search engine but didn't released still.

## Commands
        - `/chat [Any prompt]` Talk with GPT-3!
        - `/imagine [Any prompt]` Generate any image which you want using DALL-E 2.0!
        - `/public` Make GPT-3 prompts public.
        - `/private` Make GPT-3 prompts private.
        - `/reset` Clear all requests which was sent by user to GPT-3.

## How to setup it?
Setup your api keys in env.dev and rename it to .env in folder on your PC, also view [this source](https://github.com/Zero6992/chatGPT-discord-bot#setup) for more info about setting up your bot. (it's almost same and won't ruin anything related to gpt3)

## Which sources was used?
https://github.com/TheExplainthis/ChatGPT-Discord-Bot/blob/main/README.en.md (DALL-E 2.0 command)
https://github.com/Zero6992/chatGPT-discord-bot (help/chat/private/public/reset commands)

Also, when it was made `Zero6992` didn't have a DALLE 2.0 command in his bot, so I also used another solution at the time.

## It still have any issues?
DALL-E picture logging is works but any cyrillic language turns into "???" on selfhost.

## I'm searching for logs!
- GPT-3: chatgpt_discord_bot.log
- DALL-E 2.0: dalle_discord_bot.log

## You can use GPT-3 everywhere where you want.
I don't care about it now, because I have more better version of this. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
