# GPT-3 - Source
Okay, thats the real source of the GPT-3 discord bot which could generate DALL-E 2.0 images and GPT-3 prompts.
We are using discord.py library, so don't forget about it.
Also, it's should support google search engine but it didn't released still.

## Commands
        - `/chat [Any prompt]` Talk with GPT-3!
        - `/imagine [Any prompt]` Generate any image which you want using DALL-E 2.0!
        - `/public` Make GPT-3 prompts public.
        - `/private` Make GPT-3 prompts private.
        - `/reset` Clear all requests which was sent by user to GPT-3.

## How to setup it?

Also, some commands was made by me and fixed too.

## It still have any issues?
Don't use it on lagging pc, just make sure your computer can run few tasks without any problems.
Also, it can create unfinished prompts on russian, ukrainian and other languages. Use an English language when you are using it to avoid any problems.
Additional: DALL-E picture logging is works but russian language or other just turns into "???".
